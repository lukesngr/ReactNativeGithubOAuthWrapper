# ReactNativeGithubOAuthWrapper

Uses Axios library to follow the Github OAuth protocol and get token to allow Github login as authorization for a React Native App 
Haven't been using this in project for a long time though was a fun and good learning project for me to learn about the OAuth protocol

I am getting the server to do majority of actions just redirect once it has the access token
This is not a module more like a collection of code to add to the various part of the project I am working on that implements this code
Unfortunately in retrospect, the issue I had with expo and github can be resolved by manually editing the builds of ios and android
I am still gonna try this out but wonder if it's inefficent as can just do this in react native code
Nevertheless this is a brilliant way to learn about oauth and the github api
